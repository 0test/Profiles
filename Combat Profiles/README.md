###How To Use
- Browse and open a profile in the GitHub Browser or by using a SVN Client to fetch updated profiles.
- When you open the profiles you will get all the information you need to run the profile: Spec, Talent Build, Suggested Weapons & Macro's (if needed, mostly you dont need macros).
- Download the profile, either by using SVN or just simply copy & paste the code into notepad and save it as a .cpr file.
- Load the Profile into your Vanilla Bot (If you dont see it in the profile list, try refreshing the profile list).
- When you have successfully found and loaded the profile, you need to click Grind 2 Times to initiate the profile, then click Active to start it.
